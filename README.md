# ASAR
Generalization of the code used to write the paper [A Novel Path-finding Approach for Maritime Search and Rescue Missions Incorporating Dynamic Probability of a target Location](https://www.tandfonline.com/)

## Usage
This repository is not intended to be a plug-and-play solution to implement that algorithm. It only serves as a more concrete look into how the implementation might work. That said, a very generic example is included in `asar_opendrift.py` with the required _OpenDrift_ files located in the `/data`. Furthermore, this repository contains no information as how to generate these files. However, if you are interested in further details, don't hesitate to contact any of the papers authors. 

## Requirements
`pip install numpy networkx tqdm seaborn`
